"""Medical-question guardrail v1: input-side refusal and output-side risk check.

Scope is deliberately narrow: this catches questions and answers that read as
asking for or giving a diagnosis, a prescription, or a medication/dosage. It does
not catch harmful *training method* advice (e.g. flooding) — that is a separate,
unbuilt defense (docs/agenda_0825.md, 안건 3). Scope is not something this module
should grow on its own; if a caller wants training-harm coverage, that is a new
lexicon and a new stage, not an extension of MEDICAL_TERMS.

Two independent checks, matched against different text:

  classify_input(question)   — question text against MEDICAL_TERMS (질환·증상
                                vocabulary dumped from the frozen graph by
                                scripts/build_medical_lexicon.py). Runs before
                                any retrieval, and before the existing score_gap
                                gate in scripts/run_combined_retrieval_eval.py.
                                On a MEDICAL verdict, the caller must return
                                VET_REFERRAL_MESSAGE immediately and skip
                                retrieval and generation entirely.

  classify_output(answer)    — generated answer text against MEDICAL_TERMS *and*
                                PRESCRIPTIVE_MARKERS. This exists because
                                classify_input only sees the question, and a
                                question that does not name a disease or symptom
                                can still pull disease/symptom evidence into a
                                hybrid-merged context (graph search walks 2 hops
                                from whatever the question *does* match) and come
                                back out in the generated text. Mentioning a
                                disease/symptom by name is not enough to act on —
                                Q16 in owner_fixtures.jsonl is a fixture that is
                                expected to be ANSWERed even though it names
                                "슬개골 탈구" and "관절 통증" outright, because it asks
                                what behavior a diagnosed dog shows, not what to
                                do about it. What must be caught is the answer
                                *prescribing*: a drug, a dose, a treatment. So a
                                BLOCK verdict requires a disease/symptom term
                                *and* a prescriptive marker in the same text;
                                a disease/symptom term alone downgrades to a
                                disclaimer.

Both checks do plain substring matching, the same style
scripts/run_combined_retrieval_eval.py already uses for graph entity seeding
(match_seeds) and guardrail/seed_lexicon.json already uses for its symptom
phrases. No stemming, no tokenization — matching what is already the codebase's
convention rather than introducing a second matching strategy this v1 has no
measurement to justify.

v2 addition — classify_input_v2(question, medical_terms, whitelist_terms):

v1's MEDICAL_TERMS came from frozen/frozen_stage2_0820.jsonl, i.e. entities the
training-video corpus itself talks about. That was the wrong source for this
job: a guardrail that exists to catch medical questions the corpus has no
business answering needs vocabulary for medicine *outside* the corpus, not a
dump of what the corpus already discusses. It also went wrong in the other
direction — several extracted "증상" entities (짖음, 불안, 분리불안, 하울링) are
ordinary training vocabulary that a symptom-labeling pass over training-video
transcripts was always going to produce, because a problem behavior and a
symptom description overlap heavily in how owners talk. See
reports/medical_guardrail_v1v2_comparison.md for the measured cost of both
failure modes.

v2 (data/guardrail/medical_terms_v2.json) is a hand-authored list of general
veterinary vocabulary — procedures, products, emergency symptoms, clinical
actions — chosen without reference to what this corpus happens to contain.
data/guardrail/training_whitelist_v1.json is checked first and, on a match,
overrides any v2 dictionary hit: a question containing 짖음/분리불안/불안/하울링/
배변/산책/사회화 passes regardless of what else it contains. That is a known,
deliberate trade-off (see the whitelist file's known_tradeoff field), not an
oversight — a question that genuinely mixes a training topic with a real
emergency (e.g. "산책 중에 발작을 일으켜요") will pass under this rule.

v1 is kept, unmodified, alongside v2. It is not a superseded artifact to
delete — it is the recorded evidence for why sourcing a medical guardrail's
vocabulary from the corpus's own extraction was the wrong design.

apply_output_guardrail() and SystemAuthoredText — the self-block incident:

scripts/generate_answers.py's MEDICAL_REFUSAL_TEMPLATE ("가까운 동물병원에서
수의사의 진료를 받으시길 권합니다...") contains "병원" (a medical_terms_v2 entry)
and "처방" (a PRESCRIPTIVE_MARKERS entry) in the same hand-written sentence —
exactly the co-occurrence classify_output_v2 exists to catch. Run naively, the
guardrail written to keep unsafe *model* text out of a reply would have blocked
its own safe, hand-authored replacement text and shown OUTPUT_BLOCKED_MESSAGE
instead. First version of the fix (2026-08-20, same day) just skipped the
function call at that one call site — correct in effect, but the exemption
lived in generate_answers.py's control flow, not on the text itself. Anything
later routed down that same "no model call" branch would have silently
inherited the same bypass, model-generated or not, with nothing forcing a
re-check.

SystemAuthoredText fixes that: it marks the *value*, not the code path. A
caller that has hand-written, pre-vetted text wraps it before handing it to
apply_output_guardrail(); anything unwrapped — a plain str, which is what
every model client in this file returns — is real generated text and gets the
full classify_output_v2 check regardless of which branch produced it. A future
edit that starts putting model output where MEDICAL_REFUSAL_TEMPLATE used to go
gets checked automatically, because a plain str was never exempt.

v2 addition — classify_output_v2(answer, medical_terms_v2, whitelist_terms):

scripts/generate_answers.py wired classify_output into real generation on
2026-08-20 using v1's terms and immediately hit v1's own documented flaw:
"분리불안"/"불안" — ordinary training vocabulary, not a diagnosis — appeared in
two demo answers and both got OUTPUT_DISCLAIMER appended, unrelated to whether
the answer was medical. classify_output_v2 applies classify_input_v2's already-
accepted whitelist-first precedence to the output side instead: a whitelist hit
passes the text through untouched, same known trade-off as classify_input_v2
(a real emergency mentioned alongside a whitelist word passes uncaught — see
the whitelist file's known_tradeoff field). v1's classify_output is kept,
unmodified, for the same reason v1 itself is kept: recorded evidence, not a
deleted mistake.
