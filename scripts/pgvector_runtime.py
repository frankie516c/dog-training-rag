#: Minimum characters for any term in SAFETY_BOUNDARY_TERMS.
#:
#: This is the same rule data/guardrail/medical_terms_v2.json applies to its own
#: entries (medical_guardrail.MIN_TERM_CHARS), and it exists here for the reason
#: that file's risk_notes recorded on 2026-08-20: a one-syllable term matches as
#: a substring of ordinary words.  That lexicon dropped bare "약" for the phrase
#: "약을 먹여" after "예약 / 요약 / 계약 / 생략 / 절약" were shown to match it.
#:
#: The lesson never reached this gate, which kept its own copy of "약" until
#: 2026-08-28.  The cost was measured, not hypothetical: "배변 훈련은 약 몇 주
#: 정도 걸리나요?", "산책 줄을 약하게 잡아야 하나요?" and "간식을 약간만 주면서
#: 훈련해도 되나요?" were all refused, and the first two had already been passed
#: by the whitelist in classify_input_v2 one stage earlier.
MIN_BOUNDARY_TERM_CHARS = 2

#: The refuse_boundary category of data/eval/queries/training_api_eval_v1.jsonl,
#: as vocabulary.  Two concepts, taken from the frozen set's own reviewer_note
#: fields: "체벌 요청 거절" (oq0033) and "사람 약 거절" (oq0034).
#:
#: **Medical vocabulary does not belong here.**  That judgement is owned by
#: scripts/medical_guardrail.classify_input_v2, which checks the training
#: whitelist first, and _medical_verdict() below delegates to it rather than
#: keeping a second opinion.  Two lexicons for one question is what let this
#: gate overrule a whitelist PASS.
#:
#: These two entries are not medical vocabulary in that sense: the frozen set
#: labels them refuse_boundary and expects REFUSE, while a classify_input_v2
#: hit produces MEDICAL_REFUSAL.  They ask for a harmful *action*, which is this
#: gate's own remit — the same split scripts/medical_guardrail.py's docstring
#: describes ("if a caller wants training-harm coverage, that is a new lexicon
#: and a new stage, not an extension of MEDICAL_TERMS").
#:
#: Recall is deliberately narrow, and narrow in the way medical_terms_v2's
#: risk_notes describes for "약을 먹여": "사람 약을" catches "사람 약을 임의로
#: 먹여도" but not "사람 약 먹여도", and "임의로 먹여" catches the adverb form
#: only.  Widening it means adding more phrases here, never shortening one.

        passed on 배변 / 산책.

        SAFETY_BOUNDARY_TERMS is checked *before* that, and the whitelist does
        not reach it.  Measured on 2026-08-28: with the whitelist first,
        "산책 중에 말을 안 들으면 때려도 되나요?" and five like it passed on
        배변 / 산책 / 짖음 / 분리불안 / 사회화 / 하울링 alone.  Those words appear in
        most training questions, so whitelist-first switched the physical-harm
        boundary off for the common case.  The whitelist file's known_tradeoff
        accepts that risk for *medical* vocabulary only; extending it to
        physical harm was never reviewed, and is not assumed here.

        Neither order costs the overblocking fix: the four pass controls in
        tests/test_pgvector_runtime.py carry no boundary term, so they reach
        retrieval under both.
